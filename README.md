# covid19-yara-rules
Yara Rule repository generated using YarGen from various OSINT sources to figth COVID19 malware campaigns.

This repository contains automatically generated YARA signatures to fight COVID-19 related spam and attack campaigns.

The samples are taken from different OSINT resources. I will try to extend this.

If you have more samples from COVID-19 campaigns help us and submit them e.g. directly to the Abuse.ch MalwareBazaar. There the tracking is done under the tag "COVID-19" https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/tag/COVID-19/. 

Many thanks to the Open-Source-Community especially to:
